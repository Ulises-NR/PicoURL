## About The Project
This is a URL shorter application built with Next.js, Auth.js and Redux. The project showcases how to implement user authentication.
Unauthenticated users can generate a shortened link that automatically expires after 5 minutes. Once expired, they can create a new link under the same conditions.
Authenticated users, on the other hand, have full control over their linksâ€”they can create, edit, delete shortened URLs without restrictions.
